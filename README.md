AMPchat (pre-alpha)
===================


----------------
What is AMPchat?
----------------

**AMPchat** is a cross-platform client-server application based on the 
commonly used **Apache + MySQL + PHP** software bundle. Thus, the stack 
of **PHP**, **JavaScript**, **SQL**, **HTML** and **CSS** languages is 
used to develop this service.

The web application is designed to provide to users a multi-chat service 
via web browser. Using the service, the user is able to get the following 
main features:

* sign up to the service and log in to your account;
* communicate with other users using varios of devices;
* share files and documents with others, etc.

The application may be useful for various kinds of open and closed groups 
and communities, communication within companies and so on. You should use 
the SSL (HTTPS) protocol, if you need to protect your global traffic.

UI Specification
----------------

The main thing about the User Interface is it must be **adaptive** and have 
to be adjustable for three types of user devices (smartphones, tablets and 
desktops) at least. A list of other basic User Interface features is 
represented below.

**Login maintenance:**

* A user does no have any chat function before he entered the service;
* The user can see other users --who are online-- only after logging in;
* The feature named 'Remember me' to be present on the logon page, the 
service must recognize users who has this option enabled;

**User invitations:**

* Once a user is logged in, he can see a list of users who are online;
* Users can invite online users of chat and accept invitations from others;
* Multi-chat (conference chat) feature - the user can invite a chat as 
many people as he likes;
* Invited users can go out from somebody's chat, only if they want to - no 
administrators or moderators of the chat-rooms there;
* The user can be at the same time in as many chats as he wishes;

**Main interface:**

* The main chat interface should be presented in two parts: the input area 
and the list of messages;
* The input area should be on the lower side, the list of messages - on 
the top;
* Messages should be growing from the bottom up, the new message must 
appear below older ones;
* The messages must be sorted by creation (sending time);
* Messages from different users must have the visual contrast of the others;
* If there are many messages in the chat, the user can be able to see them 
all by scrolling them from the bottom up;
* When the user scrolls the messages up, they must be downloaded from server 
part by part, there is no need to download a huge list of messages at once; 

**Additional features:**

* Users should be able to share links, images, videos and other files;
* There should be a set of smiles for the chat as well;
* Users must have status (online, away, offline), as well as avatars;
* Chat-rooms should also have status (alive, pending, saved);
* The room is 'alive' as long as it has at least one online user in it;
* The room is 'pending' during some timeout after it contains no online 
users. But if all users closed this room, it becomes 'saved';
* The user should be able to resume the pending rooms and view the saved 
ones;
* Each user --who was in the pending room and hasn't closed it yet-- can 
resume the room to continue chat;
* A user can add an other user in 'friend list', the friends must be 
displayed above the others (in user list) and highlighted (in message list);

Tech Specification
------------------

The main goal of this project is to design and develop a client-server 
web-application with hiload ability and adaptive user interface. It should 
be an easy-to-deploy and update software with maintaining of backwards 
compatibility within all its versions.
